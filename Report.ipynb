    "\n",
    "We are currently writing a joint thesis: \"Customization and Enhancement of the FasterLIO Algorithm in Construction Environments: Insights from the Hilti SLAM Challenge\".  In the process of making Related works, we collected articles for insight. In addition, we consulted with our supervisor and asked him for articles for overview. It was surprising that the majority (9 out of 10) of these works were authored by the Chinese. We wondered if China was the leader in the field of LiDAR SLAM, or if we had a very limited sample.\n",

    "scientific papers. We filtered out the data and filled in the missing locations based on the authors and journals. After that, we conducted a statistical analysis and maked a conclusion about the evolution of the SLAM realm."

    "Including all of the above, we have formulated the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantitative Growth in SLAM Research:** Has the number of research articles on SLAM increased in China over the past 10 years, and how does this trend compare to the global growth in SLAM research publications?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation of Publication Growth:** Does the growth in the number of SLAM publications in China correlate with the growth of SLAM publications worldwide? This question aims to identify if there's a parallel trend or if China's growth in SLAM research is distinctive in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparative Analysis of Publication Quality and Quantity:** Is the number and quality (as indicated by citations, journal impact factors, and possibly other metrics like awards or recognition within the scientific community) of scientific publications on SLAM from China higher than similar publications from other countries? This involves not just a quantitative analysis but also a qualitative assessment to gauge the global standing of China's contributions to the SLAM field."

    "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms form the basis of robotics and autonomous systems, allowing them to navigate and understand their surroundings. Broadly speaking, this algorithm uses data from sensors to create a map of the environment, along with the robot's position on it. There are two main types of SLAM: visual and laser. They differ in the type of sensor used. In our work, we will focus only on the laser SLAM, which uses LiDAR to measure the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensor LiDAR (light detection and ranging) provides precise, high-resolution measurements of distances to surrounding objects. Lidar systems are classified as either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D), and they vary in field of view (FOV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossref is a nonprofit organization that enhances scholarly communication by providing a system for citation linking and metadata storage for academic content. It assigns DOIs to scholarly works, facilitating persistent access and reliable citation. Choosing Crossref for statistical analysis has several benefits due to its comprehensive database and robust metadata collection. This allows for precise tracking of publications, citations, and trends within the SLAM field.\n"
