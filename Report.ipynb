    "Including all of the above, we have formulated the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantitative Growth in SLAM Research:** Has the number of research articles on SLAM increased in China over the past 10 years, and how does this trend compare to the global growth in SLAM research publications?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation of Publication Growth:** Does the growth in the number of SLAM publications in China correlate with the growth of SLAM publications worldwide? This question aims to identify if there's a parallel trend or if China's growth in SLAM research is distinctive in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparative Analysis of Publication Quality and Quantity:** Is the number and quality (as indicated by citations, journal impact factors, and possibly other metrics like awards or recognition within the scientific community) of scientific publications on SLAM from China higher than similar publications from other countries? This involves not just a quantitative analysis but also a qualitative assessment to gauge the global standing of China's contributions to the SLAM field."
